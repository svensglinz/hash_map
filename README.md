# Simple generic Hash Map in C 

This project is an attempt to get some practice in C which resulted in an implementation of a basic hashmap where each array element contains a linked list.

The hashmap allows for cusotm comparators, hash functions, as well as a custom allocator. Additionally, you can customize the initial capacity as well as the maximum load factor. 
Once the maximum load factor is exceeded, the map is regenerated at a capacity twice as large as the previous.
